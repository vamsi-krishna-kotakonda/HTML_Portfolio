<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a recent B.Tech graduate with a background in Computer Science, holding a cumulative grade point average of 7.54. 
  Throughout my academic journey, I have developed a solid foundation in programming languages such as Python, SQL, HTML, and JavaScript, 
  alongside practical experience with data analytics tools like Excel and Power BI. My final-year project focused on data-driven crime prediction, 
  where I contributed not only to the development and analysis but also ensured comprehensive documentation, 
  giving me insight into structured project execution.</p>

<p>Beyond academics, I have actively participated in college-level extracurricular activities. Serving as a coordinator for the ISTE college club for 
  over 1.5 years, I honed my skills in event promotion, student engagement, and effective communicationâ€”qualities that have shaped my ability to work 
  with teams and manage responsibilities efficiently. This experience has enhanced my problem-solving approach and adaptability, 
  qualities I aim to carry forward into professional settings.</p>

<p>I am looking to build a career in roles related to data analysis, business analysis, or technical support, where I can apply my technical 
  abilities, structured thinking, and collaborative mindset. My goal is to contribute to projects that require both analytical reasoning and 
  effective communication, whether through structured data handling, risk management processes, or client-focused tasks. I am committed to 
  continuous learning and growth, open to new challenges, and ready to adapt to evolving work environments.</p>
